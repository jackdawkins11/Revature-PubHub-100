# Book publishing website
This is a website I worked on while doing online training with Revature. I added one main feature: Book tags. This included adding a new database table, writing a java class that represented a book tag, writing a Data Access Object to interface with the database, writing and updating servlets for adding, deleting and finding book tags and updating jsp files for these same operations.

# Tools used
* Wildfly
* Java Servlets
* Java Database Connection
* Postgresql
* Java Server Pages 

The site is deployed on AWS here: http://52.15.174.58:8080/PubHub/BookPublishing
